This project is a simple simulation of e-shop. The main scope was to imitate e-shop's functionality without giving importance to visual design, aesthetic appeal and responsiveness.

These are the features that I was focused on:

1) Logging in / Signing in.
2) Adding items to the cart.
3) Changing quantity in the cart.
4) Making an order.
5) Checking the info of submitted order.
6) Canceling the submitted order.
7) Viewing and changing personal info.
8) Showing different information and features depending on the data provided by the user.
